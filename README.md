Creating a protocol where a user will go through three phases in virtual reality while walking on the Infinadeck omnidirectional treadmill. The first phase consists of the user attempting to walk in a straight line for a set distance of 20m. The second phase consists of the user walking through some sort of maze while their perspective is being slightly spun (based on their walking speed) without them knowing it's being spun. This is done for a set distance of 20m. The third phase consists of the user trying to walk in a straight line again just like the first phase. This is done to analyze how changing motion perception in virtual reality affects walking patterns. This protocol is being created in Unity Verison 2021.3.7f1 and is currently a work in progress. 

Thanks to Infinadeck for the treadmill and the plugins from the Unity Store.
